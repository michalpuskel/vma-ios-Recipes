Place turkey in a Dutch oven or roasting pan. Separate the skin over the
breast to make little pockets. Put 3 tablespoons of the butter on both
sides between the skin and breast meat. This makes for very juicy
breast meat.

seasoning salt over the turkey.

degrees C). For the last 45 minutes or so, remove the foil so the turkey
will brown nicely.
